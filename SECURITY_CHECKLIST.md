SECURITY REMEDIATION CHECKLIST
==============================

CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES TO FIX:

□ SQL Injection
  - Use parameterized queries/prepared statements
  - Validate and sanitize all user inputs
  - Use ORM frameworks properly

□ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Escape all user outputs
  - Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - Validate input on both client and server side

□ Command Injection
  - Never use shell=True with user input
  - Use subprocess with argument lists
  - Validate and whitelist allowed commands

□ Path Traversal
  - Validate file paths
  - Use os.path.join() and os.path.abspath()
  - Implement proper access controls

□ Insecure Deserialization
  - Avoid pickle with untrusted data
  - Use safe serialization formats (JSON)
  - Implement signature verification

□ Hardcoded Credentials
  - Use environment variables
  - Implement proper secrets management
  - Never commit secrets to version control

□ Weak Cryptography
  - Use strong hashing algorithms (bcrypt, scrypt)
  - Generate cryptographically secure random numbers
  - Implement proper key management

□ Information Disclosure
  - Remove debug information in production
  - Implement proper error handling
  - Audit log contents for sensitive data

□ Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  - Validate and whitelist URLs
  - Use internal DNS resolution
  - Implement network segmentation

□ Insecure Configuration
  - Change default passwords
  - Disable debug mode in production
  - Implement proper access controls

ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES:

□ Input Validation
  - Validate all user inputs
  - Use whitelisting over blacklisting
  - Implement proper data types

□ Authentication & Authorization
  - Implement multi-factor authentication
  - Use secure session management
  - Follow principle of least privilege

□ Security Headers
  - Implement CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options
  - Use secure cookie flags
  - Add security-related HTTP headers

□ Dependency Management
  - Keep dependencies updated
  - Use dependency scanning tools
  - Audit third-party libraries

□ Logging & Monitoring
  - Log security events
  - Monitor for suspicious activities
  - Implement alerting mechanisms

□ Secure Development Practices
  - Code reviews with security focus
  - Static and dynamic security testing
  - Security training for developers
